This project had a total of three components that we needed to implement. Those were to use graphics from
p5, add sound to the project with Tone, and to add real world interaction through the Arduino. 
For my graphics I decided to make the classic game of Pong. I was able to use css to modify how the game
board looked and how the ball and padles looked. For the Tone sound section I used a loop, a pattern, and a 
sequence all together to have background audio for the game. Then I used another audio source that was 
modulated with a LFO and an envelop. I decided not to use any pre-recorded audio samples for my game.
Next with the physical computing through an Arduino, I had it setup to where when any of the players scored,
three led's would light up for about half a second. If I were to do further work on the project, I would
change the user inputs from the keyboard on the computer, to joy sticks or buttons on the Arduino bread board.
Below I will post a link of the project working as intended.
